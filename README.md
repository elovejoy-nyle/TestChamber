# TestChamber
The TestChamber is a complex mix of multple devices, code bases, and technologies. Keeping it organized is a challenge. 
A spin off from the commericial test repo. In this repo we attempt to organize the comerical test chamber code devices and documentation in a way that can be sensibly managed.

At present time there are 4 PLCs in use on the TestChamber Eco-System. These are:
Chamber
LoggerPLC
TestStation
Unit_in_testing

Other devices include a Groov Epic, Groov Rios, a handful of PCs, and an array of sensors. 

# Intended Orginazaion:
  Catagory: --> device--> Docs, code, checksums


Example: Current: --> specific code in use at the TestChamber today --> Docs, code, checksums.

# this is a concept repo. 
* intrim goal: simplify the knowlegdge required to track testchamber programs and settings. 
* single source for TestChamber docs.
* long term goal: Simplify, or eliminate code bases.
